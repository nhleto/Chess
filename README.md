<h1>Chess</h1>
<p>
This game was developed following the guidelines of the [Illustrated rules of Chess]
link: [https://www.chessvariants.com/d.chess/chess.html]
</p>
<p>
The game is programmed with all major chess moves in mind, including:
En passant, Pawn promotion, Castling, as well as Check and Checkmate.
</p>
<p>
The game ends when the enemy king is captured or checkmate is called.
</p>
<p>
Because the rules have not changed much in the last 1,500 years,
please refer to the link if you are confused / have questions.
